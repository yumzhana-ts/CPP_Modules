# Subject: Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

## Study :
    - Protected: 
    for attributes to be seen for inherited class it has to be under proctected type
    - Inherited constructor 
    A derived class constructor is responsible for initializing the derived part of an object. 
    It must call the appropriate base class constructor to ensure that the base part 
    is initialized correctly.
    - Polymorphism
    Polymorphism allows methods to be defined in a base class and overridden in derived classes, 
    enabling different behaviors while using the same interface. 

## Implementation: 
    Scav Trap inherited from Clap Trap with different default attribute values.
