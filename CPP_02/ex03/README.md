# Rule of Orientation:
- Positive Orientation: If all cross products are positive, then point P lies inside triangle ABC.
- Negative Orientation: If all cross products are negative, then point P also lies inside triangle ABC.
- Mixed Orientation: If the orientations are mixed (e.g., one positive and another negative), 
then point P lies outside or on the boundary of triangle ABC.This rule is based on the concept that the cross product yields a positive value if point P is to the left of the 
direction from A to B (using the right-hand rule), and a negative value if point P is to the right of this direction.

# Implementation :

- Restrictions with const in Member Variables
In C++, member variables of a class that are declared as const must be 
initialized in the constructor's initializer list and cannot be reassigned afterwards.
