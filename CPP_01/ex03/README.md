#Pointer vs Reference in class

## In which case do you think it would be best to use a pointer to
Weapon? And a reference to Weapon? Why? 

Using a pointer, it is possible to initially point to nothing (null) and later point to a newly created object. 
In contrast, with a reference, you must initialize it to refer to an existing object right from the beginning.
