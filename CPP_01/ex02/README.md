#Memory Addresses and Values

## References

Initialization Requirement: A reference must be initialized when it is declared.
Alias to the Original: After initialization, a reference cannot be changed to refer to another variable.
Cannot be Null: Unlike pointers, references must always refer to a valid object or variable.

## Pointer vs Reference

Output confirms that both the pointer and the reference point to the same memory location 
as the original string variable, and they all hold and provide access to the same value.
