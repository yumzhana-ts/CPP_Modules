## Subject: Exercise 00: Polymorphism

# Study: 

- Virtual functions 

Enable runtime type recognition through dynamic binding, 
allowing the correct method to be called based on the actual type of the object. 

- Subtype Polymorphism

Subtype polymorphism, also known as inclusion polymorphism or runtime polymorphism, 
is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). 

Key Characteristics of Subtype Polymorphism:
1. Inheritance:
2. Method Overriding:
3. Dynamic Binding:
