1. Which containers to use?
Stack container?


# Implementation : 

Program name
The program must be named RPN.

Input format
The program takes a mathematical expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) as an argument.

Number constraint
The numbers in the input expression will always be less than 10, but the calculations and results are not limited by this rule.

Processing the expression
The program must evaluate the given RPN expression and output the correct result to the standard output.

Error handling
If an error occurs during execution (e.g., invalid input, division by zero), an error message must be printed to the standard error.

Supported operations
The program must handle the following operators: +, -, /, and *.

Container requirement
At least one standard container (such as std::stack, std::vector, etc.) must be used in the implementation.
